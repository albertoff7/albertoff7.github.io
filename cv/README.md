# Curriculum Vitae

<p align="center"> <img src="foto_alberto_cv3.png"> </p>

From a young age, I **felt a fascination for internet technologies** and began studying them, both self-taught and through formal training in various fields. Today, I am an IT professional with over **10 years of experience creating and managing critical application architectures in production environments**. Throughout my career, I have taken on various roles, primarily in technical tasks and team management.

I am also passionate about **DevOps culture**, **AWS cloud-native infrastructure**, **automation**, **real-time monitoring**, and training in new technologies. **Proactive, responsible, and energetic**, I aim to continue expanding my knowledge and experience, creating synergies that add value wherever I go, **using technology as a strategic asset and lever**.
